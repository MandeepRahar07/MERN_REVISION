why just add some feature in javascript
its not promming language its a superset on javascript 

why typescript we are going learn =>

function sum(a,b){
    return a + b;
}
sum(2,3); 
sum(ture, "ok") //run time error will come 
//we cant  pass boolean and string
// this behaivor are litle bit gatiya of javascript
/// in main project these function are more complex
// we not going to check what we passed in the parameter
// only after the run the code we are able to what is the error in the code
//.................//
// stack owerflow
// now its most popular language


function sum(a:number,b:number){
    return a + b;
}
sum(10,20);
// sum(true, 20); // its show us an error autometic

1) java why so popular bcz its so much flexible
